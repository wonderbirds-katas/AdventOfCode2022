### Domain Model

The domain is split into two parts.

The upper part of the Domain Model diagram shows the stock and stack related entities.

- A crate is represented by a `char` value, which holds the crate mark.
- The stack of crates is represented by the `CrateStack`. Its `Top` crate is the one accessible for the Elves.
- The `OrderedStock` class provides the `Move` function to move crates from one `CrateStack` to an other. The `TopCrates` property lists the `Top` crates of the managed `CrateStack`s. The stock is considered `ordered`, because every `CrateStack` has a unique index.

The lower part of the Domain Model diagram shows the entities for handling the rearrangement instructions.

- A `RearrangementStep` specifies how many crates to move, from which `CrateStack` to take them and onto which `CrateStack` to add them.
- The `RearrangementProcedure` holds the list of steps.

### Domain "Services"

- The `CargoCraneOperator` executes the steps of a `RearrangementProcedure` on an `OrderedStock`.

### Adapters

- The initial `OrderedStock` is constructed by the `StockSpecificationDeserializer`. This class reads the input file and sets up the `CrateStack`s represented by the first section.
- The `RearrangementProcedure` is read from the input file by the `RearrangementProcedureDeserializer`.
