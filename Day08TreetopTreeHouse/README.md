- [Puzzle Instructions for Part 2](./PUZZLE-PART-2.md)

## Build and Test

See [Instructions in the parent folder](../README.md).

## Run the Application

From this folder, run the following command to execute the application:

```shell
dotnet run --project Day08TreetopTreeHouse -- --file Day08TreetopTreeHouse/input.txt
```

ATTENTION:

This application differs from the previous solutions in the way the command line
arguments are handled. As a consequence you must specify the `--file` option
explicitly.
